# ChemSchematicResolver Tutorial


**ChemSchematicResolver** is a toolkit for the automatic resolution of chemical schematic diagrams and their labels.

This guide provides a quick tour through ChemSchematicResolver concepts and functionality.

## Features

- Extraction of generic __R-Group__ structures
- Automatic __detection__ and __download__ of schematic chemical diagrams from scientific articles
- HTML and XML document format support from the [__RSC__](https://www.rsc.org/), [__Elsevier__](https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html) and [__Springer__](https://www.springer.com)
- High-throughput capabilities
- Direct extraction from image files
- PNG, GIF, JPEG, TIFF image format support
